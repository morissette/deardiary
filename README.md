Inside the mind of a crazy person talking to themself.

# 2024-02-01
I am reading "The Diary of Anne Frank" for what must be the unth time and I am trying to slowly consume it on the days that the entries were written vs reading it as a novel. Her next entry is February 5th 1943 so until then I shall write not. The day not the date as I have yet to discover the physics of time travel. Please know that I am not a crazy person talking to myself. I am a crazy person talking to a computer. There is a difference.

This serves as the introduction to my diary.

Surely, you have better things to do than continue forth.

The remaining entries shall be written as git commit messages. So maybe its time for you to learn git ha or use the GUI, but where is the fun in that?

Peace, love, joy and maybe have a laugh or two. 

And as Mary Poppins would say, "Everything is possible, even the impossible."

So dream the impossible.
